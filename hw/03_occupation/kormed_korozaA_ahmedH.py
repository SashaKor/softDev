#TASK 1: Write a Python script to read in the file and
#build an appropriate dictionary from it.
#Make sure the percentages are stored as numbers.

# TASK 2: Create a function that returns a randomly
#selected occupation where the results are weighted by the percentage given.
#For example, there should be a 6.1% chance that
#"Education, training and library" is returned.
